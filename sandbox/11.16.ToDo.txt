Ideas for the meeting tomorrow, 11/16:
Maybe we should just decide on 1 function that for sure returns the right X (not the X Tilde!) and split up the work of writing work intensive functions

functions needed:
mfa(). Should return an object of class mfa with

@param eigenvalues. Use getEigenvalues / summary.mfa(eigenvalues)

@param factorScores. Use getFactorScores

@oaram partialFactorScores. Use getpartialFactorScores
 
@param matrix Loadings. Use getMatrixLoadings

Should maybe also contain 
@param X. The matrix on which everything is based, and 
@param alpha. Eventually even the svd?

  
summaryEigenvalues.mfa(MFA) (Up to here everything should be implemented by one person - did someone already define a function that does that? 
I somehow fail to return the summary of the eigenvalues)

getContributionObDim()

getContribtutionVarDim()

getContributionTableDim()

RV(table1, table2)

RV_table(dataset, sets)

getLgCoefficient(table1, table2)
